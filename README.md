FAQ

Why can’t I move (left or right) after hitting a wall?
  
   -Well when our code detects that you’ve hit an object we run a command to prohibit moving to the right. For example: Iris walks straight, Iris sees a wall, Iris hits the wall, Iris stops moving straight, Iris can fly up, Iris is over the wall but still can’t go straight because she fell asleep!Therefore, Iris will only move forward when she is woken back up. (Just press right again.)

This is too easy! Will it get harder?
   
   -You see, Iris, after passing level intervals of 5 the game will began to be much more difficult and offer many new challenging and stressing puzzles!

I found a bug, who should I report this too?

   -Bugs help us developers stop problems occurring and sometimes even spark new creations! If you find one, make sure to tell us on the https://github.com/Royalkiller2222/royalkiller2222.github.io/issues  page so we can have offer the best game experience we possiably can!

Who is Iris?
  
  -We really don’t know, try asking Iris yourself.
